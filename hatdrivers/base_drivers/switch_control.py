    This is a class that is used to control all the Mini Circuits swtiches we have.
    To use this in the qtlab, do:

    from hatlab import switch_control
    SWT = switch_control.SWT()
    
    then you can just use SWT like a usual switch (I make the method name to be the 
    same as that in the single switch driver so it will be easy to use).
