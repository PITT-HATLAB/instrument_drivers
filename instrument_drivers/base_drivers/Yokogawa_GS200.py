#The Qcodes driver does pretty much everything I need it to, 
#the problem is that it's not formatted like we used to have it
#So this driver will subclass the qcodes driver 
#(at: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/yokogawa/GS200.py)
#and just add a few things that we used before
